## Welcome to From the Lap!!

Hello!

Welcome to **By the Lap**: Orly’s swim stat blog. 
I’m a competitive master’s swimmer with an (un)healthy obsession with NCAA and professional swim ming. 
By day I am a data scientist, and I decided to combine my love for coding and my love for swimming. 
Voila! Swim statistics blog.

My background in statistics combined with my job experience since finishing school serve as the baseline for my data analysis approach. 
It continues to evolve, and I continue to learn more as I branch out. 
Right now I mainly work with budget data, and swimming data is far from that, but as I always say, data is data!! 
And I want it all.

What to expect:
+ A quote (which I used to do at every practice when I coached my college club team)
+ Detailed walk-throughs of overcoming challenges presented by doing analytics on sports data that is not easily available or usable
+ My data analysis approach
+ Code snippets
+ Swim headlines of my own (fueled by data!)

What’s the first topic!!

It was March Madness recently, and of course I am referring to NCAA swimming championships and not basketball. 
Land sports are stupid.

I wanted to look at the qualifiers for the women’s championship meet and go from there. 
Follow-up questions using results will be qualifiers by school vs. medalists, historical qualifiers, etc.

Men’s champs will come later. 
The first night was wild – with three DQs in the first relay! 
Florida blowing an early lead against Texas! 
This of course led to some questions about relay DQs in the past… another great topic we’ll get to.

The challenge in swimming analytics is that, unlike for basketball and football, data is not always readily accessible or in a usable format. 
For qualifiers for the NCAA championships, I have the pdf, and it took some finagling to get the data into a dataframe. 
I wanted to review this step by step because the joke about data science being 80% data cleaning and 20% analyzing data is inaccurate. 
It’s more like 90/10. I have the data! And I can’t use it! 
Let’s see what we can do.
